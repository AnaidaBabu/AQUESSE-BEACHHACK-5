BEACH HACK 5
*PROBLEM STATEMENT
To empower and promote coastal/marine tourism there must be a full fledged platform which contains man time utilization&economy based voyages

*REPOSITORY SOLUTION
So by considering above problem statement here we are constructing an integrated web application which consist of the features like E-ticketing
(when we are considering heavy rush sea beaches there must be some adventerous activities which have a mass rush so to avoid this kind
of situation we are generating E-tickets with respective time of the event which helps the tourist to have a utilized time and structured 
enjoyable path),Gear Rental Services(As for tourists its all about to have a great experience in their travel path,so to do activities like fishing
they need to buy the fishing rod itself which is more expensive so to make it more economical we here using the rental system which will 
decline the expense line and make the voyage more excitable)

*WHY THIS
As tourism makes a great impact in the global economy itself.So to promote the marine tourism by the most effective time utilizing and to
construct more economical environment we are implementing this project.By adding this two features tourists will be more engaged in the tourism
without any economical or tour factors.

*ASSUMPTION
Here we look forward this project to collaborate with KTDC,which helps us to make tourists more reliable and make the implementation more 
easier and efficient.
